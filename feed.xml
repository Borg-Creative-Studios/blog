    We are excited to announce that BCS Social is now in beta!
  </p>

  <p>
    But what makes it special?
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, BCS Social is designed for the people who hate Mondays. Yes, that’s right. BCS Social is also curated by the people, not an algorithm. When a user creates a post, it is reviewed to insure that it meets content guidelines, then it goes to the voting booth. At the voting booth, users vote on posts with a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Then on Mondays, the posts with the most votes go live on the feed and those that don’t make the cut are lost forever!
