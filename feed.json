Yes, that’s right. BCS Social is also curated by the people, not an algorithm. When a user creates a post, it is reviewed to insure that it meets content guidelines, then it goes to the voting booth. At the voting booth, users vote on posts with a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Then on Mondays, the posts with the most votes go live on the feed and those that don’t make the cut are lost forever!\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Check it out <a href=\"https://www.bcssocial.net/feed.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">HERE</a>.\n  </p>",
