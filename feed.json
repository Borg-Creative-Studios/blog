Almost every digital product out there has some kind of third party backend service that can read data. That is why I have carefully chosen which services and what backend systems we use at BCS. For each one I read the privacy policies and ask, \"Would I want to use this product based on this policy?\" If the answer is \"no\" or \"maybe,\" we do not utilize that service.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This is actually one of the reasons Borg Creative Studios was founded. I was trying to advertise a ministry I work worth and I could not find a marketing platform that did not excessively record viewer data that was reasonably priced.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    So, I created an ad platform.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Then a web browser.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Then a CSS library\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    And the next thing I knew I was filing the articles of incorporation.\n  </p>",
